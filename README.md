# phy documentation

**phy** is a new electrophysiological data analysis package for high-density multi-electrode arrays containing tens, hundreds, or thousands of recording sites.


## Overview

The current 0.1.0 release implements the following features:

* Read/save Kwik files, as created by the Klusta-suite (SpikeDetekt2 and klustakwik).
* Interactive visualization of:
    * waveforms with probe geometry
    * multi-dimensional features
    * raw traces with clusters and spikes
* Some basic cluster statistics, mainly auto- and cross-correlograms.
* Manual clustering functionality: merging, splitting.
* A semi-automatic assistant for the manual clustering step. This assistant guides you through clusters that are candidates for merging, and allows you to quickly make decisions through a streamlined graphical interface.
