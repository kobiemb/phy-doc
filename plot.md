## Interactive plotting

phy 0.1.0 provides advanced interactive visualization routines to explore large volumes of data. These routines are based on VisPy, a Python library that leverages the graphics card acceleration for fast display of data.

> VisPy requires a graphics driver compatible with OpenGL 2.1+. Any decent computer less than ten years old will work. That being said, computers with a more recent and capable graphics cards (AMD or NVIDIA) will allow you to visualize more data.

Here are the currently-supported visualizations:

* Waveforms with probe geometry
* Multi-dimensional features
* Extracellular traces with spikes
* Matrix of auto- and cross-correlograms

All of these plots are highly interactive and let you explore your data effectively.

More interactive and static visualization routines (for publication-ready plotting, for example) will be added in future versions.
